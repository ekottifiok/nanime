# Introduction

**nanime** is a [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) module designed to integrate [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/) into your Vue/Nuxt applications seamlessly. It focuses on providing a set of **SSR-safe** composables and components, abstracting away the complexities of lifecycle hooks and target selection.

## Why nanime?

Animation libraries often require careful handling of DOM elements, especially in a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) environment like Nuxt. `nanime` solves this by:

- **SSR Safety**: Ensuring animations only run on the client-side, preventing hydration mismatches.
- **Composable API**: Offering `useAnimate` and `useWaapiAnimate` for flexible usage within your `script setup`.
- **Declarative Components**: Providing transition components that are easy to drop into your templates.
- **Zero Boilerplate**: No need to manually manage `onMounted` or `onBeforeUnmount` for basic animations.
